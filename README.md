# 1. Adding text and pictures
We start by initializing the repository and adding several pictures and text documents in the "Imagenes_texto" folder.

After installing git LFS, we track .jpg and .png images.

We then add the generated .gitattributes files and add the now tracked images again.

We then commit and add the address for the remote origin.

Finally, we add one new image and text document, the image already being tracked by LFS.

# 2. Adding a Unity Project
We create a unity project in another directory of the local git repository.

We download a texture and add it to LFS (this step is unnecessary, since we were already tracking .jpg files).

We find the appropriate .gitignore file ![here](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/unity) and add it to the root of the Unity Project.

We finally add the project and commit the changes.
